Introduction to Paddy

- Before the 1930s, Sri Lanka cultivated traditional rice varieties. These were tall and took 4 – 6 months to mature. These varieties were susceptible to pests and diseases and showed photosensitivity. They produced a yield of nearly 20 bushels per acre
- Since traditional rice varieties did not provide sufficient yield, old improved rice varieties were introduced in 1960 to meet the rice requirement of the growing population. These varieties were of a medium height and took comparatively less time to give the harvest. These varieties showed resistance to pests and diseases and responded to the application of chemical fertilizers. These varieties produced 60 – 80 bushels per acre.
- With the increasing population, there was a need for developing high yielding rice varieties. By so the reduction in cultivable land while meeting the challenges of increasing pest associated problems and changing climate.
Since the 1970s, the introduction of newly improved rice varieties has been done. These varieties are having characteristics of short duration, lodging resistance, pest and disease resistance. These varieties are high yielding and capable of producing about 200 bushels per acre

Rice Research and Development Institute
- Rice Research and Development Institute of the Department of Agriculture was been conducting research on the development of new high yielding traditional varieties to newly improved varieties while contributing to the agriculture development of Sri Lanka. They have so far produced nearly 86 rice varieties of different age groups.
- The island-wide network of the agriculture extension service of the Department of Agriculture, Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka are responsible for disseminating the technology related to rice production among the farming community islandwide.
- The principal research station of the Rice Research and Development institute is located at Bathalagoda and its regional research centers are situated at Bombuwela, Benthole, Ambalantota, Labuduwa, Sammanthurai, Paranthan and Manukan
- At present Sri Lanka is producing rice meeting its requirement. When considering the increasing population, rice production needs to be increased in the future. It is a challenge to find solutions to both [pests and diseases which are already established and newly stress that is affecting rice production in the passage of climate change.
